Hello! 

The DropletHistogram.py contains the code to make histograms to visualize
droplet sizes. 

IndentTestsWT.py contains the code to translate elastic  
modulus properties between APS/TEMED cured hydrogels and LAP cured hydrogels. 

cell_in_droplet_Poisson_distributation.py is the code that use stastics, taking 
cell concentration and droplet diameter as variables, to determine the 
probability distribution of the number cells encapsulated in the droplet. 

The flowratePlot.py, which requires Flowrate.py to be imported in, takes in 
an operating microfluidics device's main channel video, and determines the 
velocity of the droplets traveling down that channel. 

For more information on how to clean up the data and use these codes, you can
